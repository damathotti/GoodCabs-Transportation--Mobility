# Goodcabs Operations Analytics Project ðŸš–ðŸ“Š

Excited to share my experience and learnings from the **Goodcabs Operations Analytics Project**, a fantastic journey as part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 13**! ðŸŽ‰

## Problem Statement

Goodcabs, a cab service company focusing on tier-2 cities, aims to evaluate its **2024 performance** by analyzing key metrics such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, and trip distribution. Committed to supporting local drivers and delivering excellent passenger service, Goodcabs seeks actionable insights to enhance growth strategies and improve overall satisfaction levels.

## Project Overview

The **Goodcabs Project** involves creating a **Power BI Dashboard** to analyze and visualize operational, financial, and customer-related data for Goodcabs. This project aims to provide insights into the following areas:

- **City Performance**: Analyze performance metrics across different cities.
- **Monthly Analysis**: Review trends over time to identify patterns and growth.
- **Target Performance**: Measure against established performance targets.
- **Insights**: Extract actionable insights to help drive business strategies.

## Objectives

- **Enhance Operational Transparency**: Deliver a clear picture of daily business activities.
- **Track Performance Indicators**: Measure critical metrics such as revenue, customer engagement, and ratings.
- **Facilitate Strategic Decisions**: Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for informed decision-making.
- **Identify Patterns and Outliers**: Uncover trends and irregularities to drive business improvements.

## Key Insights & Accomplishments

- **ðŸš— Trip Patterns and Trends**: Analyzed trip data to reveal distribution and growth patterns across cities.
- **ðŸ’¬ Passenger Satisfaction**: Assessed customer feedback trends, identifying opportunities for service enhancements.
- **ðŸ’¡ Loyalty Metrics**: Investigated repeat passenger rates to derive actionable insights on retention and loyalty.
- **ðŸ“ˆ Growth Potential**: Balanced analysis of new and returning passengers to uncover growth opportunities.

## Tech Stack

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data processing and transformation.
- **SQL** (if applicable): For data queries and manipulation.

## Challenges & Learnings
**Data Cleanliness**: One of the main challenges was dealing with inconsistent and missing data. This pushed me to refine my data cleaning skills using techniques like filtering, data imputation, and outlier detection.

**Advanced Visualizations**: Power BI offers a wide range of visualization options, and getting familiar with advanced features like heatmaps, slicers, and drill-downs was both challenging and rewarding. I had to learn to make the visualizations interactive and user-friendly.

**Business Context**: Translating raw data into actionable business insights required me to better understand key performance indicators (KPIs). I learned how to align data analysis with business objectives, ensuring that the insights were relevant for decision-making.

**Time Management**: With the vast amount of data and the need for multiple iterations to refine the dashboard, effective time management became a crucial skill. I learned to prioritize tasks, break down the project into manageable phases, and continuously iterate for improvement.

## Conclusion ðŸ’¡
The Goodcabs Operations Analytics Project was an enriching and challenging experience that allowed me to sharpen my data analysis, visualization, and business strategy skills. By creating a Power BI dashboard that provided valuable insights into operational performance, customer satisfaction, and growth potential, I was able to contribute to a hypothetical company's efforts in making informed decisions.

This project reinforced the importance of understanding both the technical aspects of data and the broader business context. Looking forward to applying these lessons and creating more data-driven solutions in future projects! ðŸŒ±
